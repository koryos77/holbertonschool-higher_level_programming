Requirements


Python Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc

Python Test Cases

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!


0. Integers addition
mandatory
Write a function that adds 2 integers.

Prototype: def add_integer(a, b=98):
a and b must be integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message a must be an integer or b must be an integer
a and b must be first casted to integers if they are float
Returns an integer: the addition of a and b
You are not allowed to import any module


1. Divide a matrix
mandatory
Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.

Prototype: def matrix_divided(matrix, div):
matrix must be a list of lists of integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
Each row of the matrix must be of the same size, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message Each row of the matrix must have the same size
div must be a number (integer or float), otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message div must be a number
div can’t be equal to 0, otherwise raise a ZeroDivisionError exception with the message division by zero
All elements of the matrix should be divided by div, rounded to 2 decimal places
Returns a new matrix
You are not allowed to import any module


2. Say my name
mandatory
Write a function that prints My name is <first name> <last name>

Prototype: def say_my_name(first_name, last_name=""):
first_name and last_name must be strings otherwise, raise a TypeError exception with the message first_name must be a string or last_name must be a string
You are not allowed to import any module


3. Print square
mandatory
Write a function that prints a square with the character #.

Prototype: def print_square(size):
size is the size length of the square
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
if size is a float and is less than 0, raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
You are not allowed to import any module


4. Text indentation
mandatory
Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and :

Prototype: def text_indentation(text):
text must be a string, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message text must be a string
There should be no space at the beginning or at the end of each printed line
You are not allowed to import any module


5. Max integer - Unittest
mandatory
Since the beginning you have been creating “Interactive tests”. For this exercise, you will add Unittests.

In this task, you will write unittests for the function def max_integer(list=[]):.

Your test file should be inside a folder tests
You have to use the unittest module
Your test file should be python files (extension: .py)
Your test file should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests.6-max_integer_test
All tests you make must be passable by the function below
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
